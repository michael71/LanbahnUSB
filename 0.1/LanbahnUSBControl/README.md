# LanbahnUSB 0.1 JAVA Test Software

Model railroad accessory decoder with usb, Rev. 0.1.

An Arduino Micro is the basis for an accessory decoder for 2 signals and 4 turnouts (using Tortoise&trade; turnout motors) - directly powered via USB.

Java test software for controlling the accessory decoder with usb. This software is a Netbeans projects - and only runs on a raspberryPI (because of the dependency of the serial-port implementation on pi4j).

!! The <a href="http://pi4j.com/install.html" target="_blank">pi4j software </a> must have been installed on the raspberry PI in the "/opt" directory. pi4j is needed to control the (usb) serial ports. !!
